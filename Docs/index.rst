The AI Model Efficiency Toolkit (AIMET) is a software toolkit designed for quantizing and compressing trained models.

The primary objective of model optimization is to facilitate its deployment on edge devices like mobile phones or laptops.

AIMET employs post-training and fine-tuning techniques to optimize trained models, aiming to minimize accuracy loss during quantization or compression.

AIMET supports models from PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, and ONNX frameworks.

Quick Start
===========

To quickly install and begin using AIMET with PyTorch, see the :doc:`Quick start guide <../install/quick-start>`.

Installation
============

For other install options, including for TensorFlow and ONNX platforms or to run AIMET in a Docker container, see :doc:`Installation <../install/index>`.

User Guide
==========

For a high-level explanation of how to use AIMET to optimize a model, see the :doc:`Quantization user guide <../userguide/index>`.

Quantization Simulation Guide
=============================

For a guide to quantization simulation and its related techniques, see the doc :doc:`Quantization simulation guide <../quantsim/index>`.

Feature Guide
=============

For instructions on applying individual AIMET features, see the :doc:`Feature guide <../featureguide/index>`.

Example Notebooks
=================

To view end-to-end examples of model quantization and compression, and to download the examples in Jupyter notebook format, see :doc:`Example notebooks <../examples/index>`.

API Reference
=============

For a detailed look at the AIMET API documentation, see the :doc:`API reference <../apiref/index>`.

Release Notes
=============

For information specific to this release, see :doc:`Release notes <release_notes>`.
