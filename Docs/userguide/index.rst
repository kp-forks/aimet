This quantization user guide is organized into the following sections:

Quantization workflow
=====================

For overall workflow to quantize model using AIMET toolkit, see the :doc:`Quantization workflow <quantization_workflow>`.

Debugging guidelines
====================

For set of debugging steps to improve the performance of quantized model, see the :doc:`Debugging guidelines <debugging_guidelines>`

On-target inference
===================

For instructions on how to deploy quantized model to different target runtimes, see the :doc:`On-target inference <on_target_inference>`.
